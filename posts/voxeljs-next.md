Check out the voxel.js reboot, April 2019

Just wanted to leave a quick note on my inactive blog for any Voxel.js fans out there: Mozillian and Fellow Oregonian [Josh Marinacci](https://github.com/joshmarinacci) has been working on porting the now 5 year old Voxel.js codebase to work in modern browsers. 

He's calling his reboot Voxel.js Next, and is working on the project because his nine year old son is a huge Minecraft fan and keeps bugging him to make a web based version. 

You can check out Voxel.js Next on the [Mozilla Mixed Reality Blog here](https://blog.mozvr.com/voxeljs-next/).
