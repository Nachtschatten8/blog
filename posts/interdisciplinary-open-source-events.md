<div id="header"><h1 class="title">Interdisciplinary Open Source Community Conferences</h1></div>

A bunch of events that are community organized and not specific to one language/framework silo.

I'm a huge fan of interdisciplinary learning. As someone who attends a lot of conferences related to open source or more general knowledge sharing, I have found that I enjoy events more if they span multiple topic areas. I've spent some time curating this list and can wholeheartedly recommend spending your dollars to attend these events.

If you have a suggestion for an event that should be on this list, leave a comment on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/maxogden/322a649ff84fe1c2a680).
